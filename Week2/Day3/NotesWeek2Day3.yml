Playwright locator methods :
----------------------------

nth(), first(), and last() are Playwright Locator API methods.

They help you choose which element to act on when a locator matches multiple elements.

What is a callback function?

A callback is just a function you give to another function, and you are telling it:

👉 “When you finish your work, call this function back.”

That’s it!

Simple Example (Real Life)

Ordering Pizza

You call a pizza shop and tell them:

“Here is my number.
When the pizza is ready, call me back.”

You don’t wait on the phone.
You go do your own work.

Later, the pizza shop finishes making your pizza → they call you back.

That phone call = callback.

💻 Same Logic in JavaScript

function makePizza(callback) {

    console.log("Making pizza...");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Pizza ready!");
        callback(); // calling back
    }, 2000);

}

makePizza(() => {
    console.log("Eat the pizza!");
});

What’s happening?

You give a function → () => { console.log("Eat the pizza!"); }

makePizza() does its work.

When it's finished, it calls your function back.

*** Why do we use callbacks?

Because some tasks take time:

✔ Reading files
✔ Calling APIs
✔ Waiting for user input
✔ Waiting for timers

Instead of blocking everything, JS says:

“Give me a function, I’ll call you back when I’m done.”

***Simple one-line definition

A callback is a function passed to another function so it can run later.

How Netflix Search Works (Using Callbacks):

When you type a movie name in Netflix.
Netflix sends your search to the server
The server takes time to look for the movie

When the search result comes back → Netflix shows it to you 

function searchMovie(movieName, callback) {
    console.log(Searching for "${movieName}" on Netflix...);

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(Movie "${movieName}" found!);
        callback(); // calling back
    }, 2000);
}

searchMovie("Leo", () => {
    console.log("Display movie details to user");
});











Why callbacks are used here?

Because:

Searching the Netflix database takes time

JavaScript cannot wait and freeze the browser

So we give a callback

Netflix: “When you find the movie, call me back.”
