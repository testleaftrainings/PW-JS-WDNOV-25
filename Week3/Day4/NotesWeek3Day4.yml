Notes :
-----


enum:
-----
- Enums are a way to define a set of named constants, making your code more readable and maintainable.


Think of enum like a menu in a restaurant:

Instead of customers shouting random dish names, they choose from the menu (fixed options).

The menu items are the named constants (e.g., Menu.Pizza, Menu.Burger).

You can’t order something not on the menu (compiler error).
