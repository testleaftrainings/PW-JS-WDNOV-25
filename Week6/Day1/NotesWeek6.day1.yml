📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas!



API Fundamentals:


REST API -> Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.



Interview Based Questions :
-------------------------

1. Architectute Type?
REST API's follow's Client server archirtecture.
Micro services.

2. HTTP Request Methods :(CRUD operations--> Create Update Retrieve, Delete)
POST, PUT, PATCH, GET, DELETE

3. Difference between URI and URL?

A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that uniquely identifies a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a type of URI that specifies the resource’s location (address) and how to access it.

4. Stateless/ Statefull?

A stateless system means:
Each request is independent — the server does not remember anything about previous requests.

A stateful system means:
The server remembers information (state) between requests.

REST API follow stateless, which means request contains all the information needed to process your activity. 

5.Difference between Authentication and Authorization?
Authentication verifies identity , while authorization checks access rights.

| Concept           | **Authentication**                                   | **Authorization**                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Meaning**       | It verifies **who you are**                          | It defines **what you can do**                                           |
| **Purpose**       | Confirms the **identity** of a user                  | Grants or restricts **access/permissions**                               |
| **Happens When?** | Always happens **before** authorization              | Happens **after** authentication                                         |
| **Example**       | You log in with your username and password           | Once logged in, you can access only your own profile, not admin settings |
| **Analogy**       | Showing your ID card at the gate                     | Being allowed to enter only certain rooms based on your role             |


6. Various Response Code?
Response Codes liek 201 Created, 200 (OK), 401(Unauthorized), 404(NOt found).

200 series --> success of what api action that you implement (eg POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE )
400 series --> Client side error. (ex username, password, endpoint , request body format)
500 series --> Server side error. (ex server down)

7. Request Headers ?

Headers are key-value pairs sent along with the request that describe how the client and server should communicate.

Example : 
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

8. Schema Validation and response validation?

Schema Validation :

Schema validation checks if the data structure (keys + value types) in the response matches the expected format.

Example:

{
"id":101,
"name":"Ravi",
"isActive":true
}

{
"id":"101",           //id is a string not a number
"name":"Ravi",
"isActive":true
}

Response validation:
Response validation checks the actual values returned, not just the data type.

Example:

{
"id":101,
"name":"Ravi",
"isActive":true
}

{
"id":"101",           //wrong value reponse validation
"name":"Ravi",
"isActive":false
}

---

9. Difference between REST API and REST ASSURED?

REST API is the actual web services, while REST ASSURED is a Java Library used to test REST API's.

---
10. Path parameter and query parameter?

| Feature             | **Path Parameter**                                      | **Query Parameter**                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Identifies a **specific resource**                      | Filters or customizes the **result**      |
| **Location in URL** | Part of the **URL path**                                | Comes **after `?`** in the URL            |
| **Syntax Example**  | `/users/101`                                            | `/users?id=101`                           |
| **UsempId**           | To point to one resource (like a specific user or lead) | To send filters, search terms, or options |
| **Visibility**      | Mandatory part of the endpoint                          | Optional part of the endpoint             |
| **Separator**       | `/` slash                                               | `?` for first, `&` for multiple           |

11. Five Steps process for API testing
------------------------------------

1. Documentation
: Understanding the API’s purpose, structure, and usempId guidelines before testing.
Example: 
: Reading Swagger docs that describe how the incident API works in an application.

2. Endpoints: 
: Specific URLs that represent resources or actions to be tested.
Example: 
: https://dev356721.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident (incident resource).

3. Methods: 
: HTTP operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that define the type of action on the resource.
Example: 
: GET /incident → fetch incidents; POST /incident → create a new incident.

4. Headers: 
: Metadata sent with requests or responses to control and describe API behavior.
Example: 
Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json.

5. Authorization: 
: Security mechanism to verify and allow only valid users or systems to access the API.
Example: 
Authorization: Bearer <token> or Basic Auth with username & password.

Together, these 5 steps ensure your API test covers what, where, how, and who can access the service.

What is ServiceNow?

ServiceNow is an IT Service Management (ITSM) tool — it helps companies handle things like:

Reporting IT issues (e.g., “My laptop won’t start”)

Requesting new hardware/software

Tracking incidents, changes, and problems

Automating workflows across departments

It’s like a one-stop system for all service requests within a company — IT, HR, facilities, finance, etc.

# Serialization and Deserialization in REST API (TypeScript)

In **REST APIs**, **serialization** and **deserialization** are about **converting data between objects and a format that can travel over the network** (like JSON).

This is extremely important when working with **API testing, Playwright API testing, or frontend-backend communication**.

---

## 1️⃣ What is Serialization?

### ✅ Definition

**Serialization** is the process of **converting a TypeScript/JavaScript object into JSON** so it can be sent over HTTP.

📦 Object → 📄 JSON

---

### 🔹 Real-life analogy

Think of **serialization** like:

> Packing your luggempId into a **suitcase** before travelling ✈️

Clothes (object) → packed suitcase (JSON)

---

### 🔹 Example (REST API Request)

#### TypeScript object

```ts
const user = {
  name: "Ravi",
  empId: 30,
  city: "Chennai"
};
```

#### After serialization (JSON sent in request body)

```json
{
  "name": "Ravi",
  "empId": 30,
  "city": "Chennai"
}
```

➡️ This JSON is what actually travels over HTTP.

> In JavaScript/TypeScript, this conversion is usually done using:

```ts
JSON.stringify(user);
```

---

### 🔹 Where serialization happens

* When **client sends request body**
* While calling **POST / PUT / PATCH APIs**

---

## 2️⃣ What is Deserialization?

### ✅ Definition

**Deserialization** is the process of **converting received JSON back into a TypeScript object**.

📄 JSON →  Object

---

### 🔹 Real-life analogy

Think of **deserialization** like:

> Unpacking your suitcase after reaching your destination 🧳

Suitcase (JSON) → clothes (object)

---

### 🔹 Example (REST API Response)

#### API Response (JSON)

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Ravi",
  "empId": 30,
  "city": "Chennai"
}
```

#### After deserialization (TypeScript object)

const responseBody = await response.json(); // JSON → Object
console.log(responseBody.name); // Ravi


> This is internally similar to:

```ts
JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

---

### 🔹 Where deserialization happens

* When **client receives response**
* While validating **API responses**

---

## 3️⃣ Serialization vs Deserialization (Quick Table)

| Aspect     | Serialization | Deserialization |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Direction  | Object → JSON | JSON → Object   |
| Used in    | Request body  | Response body   |
| Happens at | Client side   | Client side     |
| Purpose    | Send data     | Read / validate |

---

## 4️⃣ Why are they important in REST API testing?

Especially useful when you do **automation** using **Playwright API**, **Axios**, or **Fetch**.

### 🔹 Benefits

✅ Cleaner code
✅ Easy request creation
✅ Type safety (with interfaces)
✅ Less manual JSON handling

---

## 5️⃣ Example in Playwright API Testing

### 🔹 Serialization (request)

```ts
await request.post("/users", {
  data: user   // Object auto-serialized to JSON
});
```

---

### 🔹 Deserialization (response)

```ts
const response = await request.get("/users/101");
const userData = await response.json(); // JSON → Object

console.log(userData.name);
```

---

## 6️⃣ Simple 

> **Serialization = Send**
> **Deserialization = Receive**

---

## 7️⃣ In short

> **Serialization** converts a TypeScript object into JSON so it can be sent in a REST API request.
> **Deserialization** converts the received JSON response back into a TypeScript object for easy processing and validation.
