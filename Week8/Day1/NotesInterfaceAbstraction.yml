
# 🏦 **Banking Analogy for Abstract Class & Interface**

 **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** controls the banking system in India.

There are many banks:

* SBI
* HDFC
* ICICI
* Axis

Each bank has its **own services and experience**, but **all must follow RBI rules**.

---

## 🧩 **1️⃣ Interface → RBI Rulebook 📘**

RBI issues **mandatory regulations** for all banks.

It says:

> “Every bank **must**:

> * provide `openAccount()`
> * support `depositMoney()`
> * support `withdrawMoney()`
> * follow `interestRatePolicy()` ”

RBI does **not** tell **how** the bank implements it — only that it **must exist**.

---

### **In Playwright / TypeScript**

export interface RBIRegulations {
  openAccount(): void;
  depositMoney(): void;
  withdrawMoney(): void;
  interestRatePolicy(): number;
}

### Purpose

* Ensures **all banks follow RBI rules**
* Framework can trust that **every bank supports these operations**
* No implementation, only **contract**

 **Key line:**

> Interface is a **law**, not a suggestion.

---

## Abstract Class → RBI Base Banking Framework**

RBI also provides **common operational guidelines**:

✔ KYC mandatory
✔ PAN / Aadhaar validation
✔ Daily withdrawal limits
✔ Audit logging

But RBI says:

> “Each bank must define:
>
> * its own interest rate
> * loan approval process
> * customer experience”

So RBI gives a **base structure** with **some ready-made logic** and **some unfinished parts**.

---

### **In Playwright / TypeScript**


export abstract class BaseBank {
  
  validateKYC(): void {
    console.log("KYC verified as per RBI norms");
  }

  auditTransaction(): void {
    console.log("Transaction logged for RBI audit");
  }

  // Must be defined by every bank
  abstract interestRatePolicy(): number;
}


### ✅ Purpose

* Shares **common RBI-mandated behavior**
* Forces each bank to define **their own policies**
* Cannot be instantiated directly

 **Key line:**

> Abstract class is a **template with blanks to fill**.

---

##  Individual Banks → Concrete Classes **

Now each bank:

* **Implements RBI regulations (interface)**
* **Extends RBI base framework (abstract class)**

---

### **Example: SBI Bank**

export class SBIBank extends BaseBank implements RBIRegulations {

  openAccount(): void {
    console.log("SBI account opened");
  }

  depositMoney(): void {
    console.log("Money deposited in SBI");
  }

  withdrawMoney(): void {
    console.log("Money withdrawn from SBI");
  }

  interestRatePolicy(): number {
    return 4.0;
  }
}

---

### **Example: HDFC Bank**

export class HDFCBank extends BaseBank implements RBIRegulations {

  openAccount(): void {
    console.log("HDFC account opened digitally");
  }

  depositMoney(): void {
    console.log("Money deposited in HDFC");
  }

  withdrawMoney(): void {
    console.log("Money withdrawn via ATM");
  }

  interestRatePolicy(): number {
    return 3.5;
  }
}
```

### ✅ Purpose

* All banks **follow RBI rules**
* All banks **reuse RBI common logic**
* Each bank has **its own business model**

---

## 4️⃣ Spec File → RBI Audit / Inspection 🧾**

RBI conducts audits to ensure compliance.

---

### 💻 **Spec File Analogy**

```ts
test("RBI Compliance Check", async () => {

  const bank: RBIRegulations = new SBIBank();

  bank.openAccount();
  bank.depositMoney();
  bank.withdrawMoney();

  console.log(bank.interestRatePolicy());
});
```

 RBI doesn’t care **which bank**, it only checks **rules are followed**.

## **Updated Summary Table**

| Playwright / OOP Concept | Banking Analogy             | Explanation                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Interface**            | RBI Regulations             | Mandatory rules every bank must follow |
| **Abstract Class**       | RBI Base Banking Framework  | Common setup + mandatory customization |
| **Concrete Class**       | SBI / HDFC / ICICI Bank     | Implements rules with own logic        |
| **Spec File**            | RBI Audit / Compliance Test | Verifies rules are followed            |

##  **In One Line **

> **Interface defines RBI rules, abstract class provides RBI’s base banking framework, and each bank implements its own policies while staying compliant.**
