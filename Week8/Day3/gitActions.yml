## 1. Creating a New Repository from Command Line


# Create README file
echo "# github-actions-novwd" >> README.md

# Initialize local repository
git init

# Commit the README
git commit -m "first commit"

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Add remote GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/ravindranr90/github-actions-aug.git

# Stage all files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push -u origin main


---

## 2. Cloning or Pulling Files from GitHub

### 🔹 First time (clone entire repo)


git clone https://github.com/ravindranr90/github-actions-aug.git
cd github-actions-aug


### 🔹 Already cloned (get latest changes)


git pull origin main


### 🔹 Pull only one specific file (less common)


git fetch origin main
git checkout origin/main -- tests/01-launchBrowser.spec.ts


---

## 3. Pushing Files to GitHub

### 🔹 Push a single file

git add tests/filename.spec.ts
git commit -m "Add test for filename"
git push origin main

### 🔹 Push multiple specific files

git add tests/filename1.spec.ts tests/filename2.spec.ts
git commit -m "Update tests filename1 and filename2"
git push origin main

### 🔹 Push all changes in a specific folder

git add tests/
git commit -m "Commit all changes inside tests folder"
git push origin main


### 🔹 Push everything inside `tests/` but not other files

(same as above)

git add tests/
git commit -m "Commit all changes inside tests folder"
git push origin main

---

## 4. Typical Update Workflow

If you edited a file in VS Code (example: `03-page-fixture.spec.ts`):

# Step 1: Stage the file
git add tests/03-page-fixture.spec.ts

# Step 2: Commit changes
git commit -m "Update test to log page title in 03-page-fixture.spec.ts"

# Step 3: Push to GitHub
git push origin main

---

✅ **Tips:**

* Always run `git status` to check staged/unstaged changes.
* Use meaningful commit messages.
* Use `git pull origin main` before pushing to avoid conflicts.

Extra Notes :
------------

🔹 U — Untracked

Means:

This file is new and Git is not tracking it yet.

It exists on your computer, but Git does not know about it.

Example from your screenshot:

01-playwrightlocators.spec.ts   U
NotesWeek2Day3.yml             U


These files were created but not added to Git yet.

To track them:

git add <filename>


or

git add .

🔹 M — Modified

Means:

This file was already in Git, but you changed it after the last commit.

Git is tracking it, but your latest changes are not committed yet.

To save the change:

git add <file>
git commit -m "Update something"

 Simple mental model
Symbol	Meaning
U	New file – Git doesn’t know it yet
M	Old file – You edited it

One-line summary 🎯

U = New file not yet in Git
M = Existing file changed after last commit
