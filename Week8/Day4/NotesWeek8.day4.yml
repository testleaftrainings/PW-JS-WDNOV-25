### 🕡 Wrap Up / Q&A












## 1️⃣ `npm i -D allure-playwright`

```bash
npm i -D allure-playwright
```

This installs **Allure Playwright adapter** inside **your project**.

📦 What it is
A **Node.js library** that connects **Playwright test results → Allure format**

🎯 What it does
It tells Playwright:

> “While executing tests, collect steps, screenshots, logs, and save them in Allure format.”

It creates:

```
allure-results/
```

JSON + attachments after test execution.

🧠 Think of this as
**📤 Data generator** (inside your test framework)

---

## 2️⃣ `npm i -g allure-commandline --save-dev`

```bash
npm i -g allure-commandline
```

This installs **Allure CLI tool** on your **machine globally**.

📦 What it is
A **report generator**

🎯 What it does
It reads `allure-results` and creates:

```
allure-report/
```

HTML dashboard

Commands it gives you:

```bash
allure generate
allure open
allure serve
```

🧠 Think of this as
**📊 Report viewer** (outside your test framework)

## 🎯 Why BOTH are required?

| Tool                 | Role                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `allure-playwright`  | Collects test data          |
| `allure-commandline` | Converts data → HTML report |

Just like:

| Selenium                 | Allure                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| TestNG generates XML     | `allure-playwright` generates JSON |
| Extent Report renders UI | `allure-commandline` renders HTML  |

---

## 🎯 Real Flow in Playwright

```text
Playwright Test Run
        ↓
allure-playwright
        ↓
allure-results (raw data)
        ↓
allure-commandline
        ↓
allure-report (beautiful HTML)
```

---

## ❌ What happens if you install only one?

| If you install            | Result                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Only `allure-playwright`  | Data generated, but no report |
| Only `allure-commandline` | No data to convert            |
| Both                      | 🎉 Full reporting works       |
