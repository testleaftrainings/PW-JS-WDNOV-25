
Prerequisites

 Node.js (v18+ recommended) and npm installed.
 A terminal and (optionally) VS Code.
 Basic familiarity with terminal commands.
 Project folder created (e.g., leaftaps-playwright).

Step 1 — Initialize Playwright project
Run the Playwright initializer (includes example prompts):
npm init playwright@latest
Follow prompts (choose TypeScript if asked). This creates a Playwright project scaffold.

Step 2 — Install Playwright Test (latest)
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
Confirm package.json has @playwright/test in devDependencies.

Step 3 — Initialize the agents
In the project root run (choose the client you will use). Example for VS Code loop:

npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode

After this, inspect what was added. Look for:
.github/chatmodes/ # or similar folder
├─ planner/ # prompts & config for Planner
├─ generator/ # prompts & config for Generator
└─ healer/ # prompts & config for Healer
These contain prompts and agent definitions (Planner, Generator, Healer).


Prompt in Planner Agent :

BaseURL :
https://leaftaps.com/opentaps/control/main

Use the below credentials to login :

Password : crmsfa

Create a new lead in a below page :
https://leaftaps.com/opentaps/control/createLeadForm

------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt in Generate Agent :

Note : Attach the planner file to the agent before running this prompt.
You are a Playwright test code generator.
Generate a Playwright test code to create a new lead in the leaftaps application using the attched planner file.



Prompt in Healer Agent :

If any test is failing, analyze the failure reason and provide steps to fix it.
Provide the fixed code snippet only without any explanation.
